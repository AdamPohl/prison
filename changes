LAST CHANGES


Actual version : 05/05/97


Version 24/04/96
----------------

. It is now possible to compute subclasses of any size.

. The result of the subclasses computation is sorted on the
number of victories of each strategy.

. Exaeco are counted.

. An analysis of roundrobin tournaments have been added.
When you ask for tournaments you obtain also
the result of this analysis that is , for each strategy
the best gap, worst gap, best score, worst score it obtained.

. When you ask for Tournaments you obtain directly
the analysis and the score without any question

. When tou ask for Generations you obtain directy
the evolution result witout any question.
It is not possible at this level to obtain the round-robin result
except if you asked for the trace before.


version 19/11/96
----------------
. The program tinypri.c has been added to the package.
  It contains a simpler version than prison.c without subclasses, domination
  but more easy to understand.
  It is in fact a good program to study with students.

. In this soft, no question is asked to the user, it is always an ecological evolution.
  All the results are stored in files with prefix 'result' 

. In tinypri.c we have added the percentage cooperation at the end
  of the result.dat file (last column).
  With gnuplot, you can then obtain the percentation cooperation curve during
  the evolution.



version 12/12/96
----------------

There was an error when you use two same strategies in the panel.
For example   prison -a 3,3

The error was only in the .cmd file which is used by Gnuplot.  In fact
the program was always using the same column of data for the two same
strategies (thus the same curve), with can be not correct.

This error has been corrected in prison.c and tinypris.c

You can test it with, for example : tinypri -R1 -S0 -a 3,3
In this case you must have a winner and a looser (not the same curve)



version 23/01/97
----------------

There was an error in tinypri.c during the cooperation cuve
computation.  In some cases it was able to obtain a negative
percentage of cooperation !.

This error comes from a cast in integer which was not correct in the
function compute_coop.

This error is now corrected.



version 10/03/97
----------------

There was an error in recop_str in tinypri.c and prison.c
The index test on dest was wrong.
It was : 
	if (source>0 && source<=max && dest<=max)
and it must be 
	if (source>0 && source<=max && dest<=NB_STRAT_MAX)


The problem appeared only when you asked for the same strategies many
times with a number of strategies more than NB_STRAT_MAX.



version 04/04/97
----------------

The names of the files of the package have been changed to 8+3
characters to run without any problem under DOS, W3.1 and W95.

For instance, all strategies files are now called *.str and the master
definition file is called strategy.h


str_12_base and str_21_suiv have been merged into classics.str.


version 05/05/97
----------------

strategy.h and classics.str have been changed.

We have tried to translate correctly all the strategy names and
associated comments.

The file translate.names contains a translation table between English
names and French names.


There was a bug in the best_of computation. The rank information was
false. So it has been changed in generations_loop (clean the stop
variable).
